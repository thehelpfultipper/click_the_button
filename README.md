#### Objective: 
To create a window with three buttons. Each button comes with a number representing the order a user is to click it.

- **first button:** changes the background color of the window
- **second button:** changes the text of the window
- **third button:** prompts entry of userâ€™s name and adds it to the text

Once the user clicks on a button, that button disappears. In the end, you have an entirely new window with a single reset button that, when clicked, returns the initial screen.
